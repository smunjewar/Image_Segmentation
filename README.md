# **Image Segmentation Using Deep Learning**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on **image segmentation**, a technique that divides an image into multiple segments where each represents an object or region of interest. By leveraging **deep learning**, we train a model to accurately segment images, helping machines identify objects much like humans do. The model is trained on a dataset containing **20 object classes** and employs **U-Net**, a convolutional neural network widely used for biomedical and general image segmentation.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras  
- **Neural Network Architectures**: U-Net, MobileNetV2, Pix2Pix (GAN)  
- **Programming & Data Handling**: Python, NumPy, Pandas  
- **Computer Vision Libraries**: OpenCV, Scikit-Image  
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Hardware Acceleration**: GPU (CUDA, TensorRT) for faster model training  

## **Dataset**  
The dataset used for training contains **20 different object classes** with labeled ground truth masks. The data is preprocessed to ensure consistency in shape, color normalization, and pixel intensity distribution.  

## **Model Architecture**  
- **U-Net** is the core architecture, known for its ability to perform precise segmentation with minimal data.  
- **MobileNetV2** is utilized for feature extraction, providing lightweight yet efficient processing.  
- **Pix2Pix (GAN)** is applied to refine segmentation results, enhancing boundary definitions and object clarity.  

## **Performance Metrics**  
The model is evaluated using the following metrics:  
- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of segmentation.  
- **Loss Function**: Computes pixel-wise classification errors.  
- **IoU (Intersection over Union)**: Evaluates segmentation quality by comparing predicted vs. actual masks.  

### **Training and Validation Performance Visualization**  
The project visualizes the modelâ€™s training progress using the following plots:  
```python
length = len(model_history.history["accuracy"]) + 1
fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(16, 8))

titles = ['Training Vs Validation Accuracy', 'Training Vs Validation Loss']
ax[0].set_title(titles[0])
ax[0].plot(range(1, length), model_history.history["accuracy"])
ax[0].plot(range(1, length), model_history.history["val_accuracy"])
ax[0].set_xlabel('Epoch')
ax[0].set_ylabel('Accuracy')
ax[0].legend(["Training", "Validation"])

ax[1].set_title(titles[1])
ax[1].plot(range(1, length), model_history.history["loss"])
ax[1].plot(range(1, length), model_history.history["val_loss"])
ax[1].set_xlabel('Epoch')
ax[1].set_ylabel('Loss Value')
ax[1].legend(["Training", "Validation"])

plt.show()
```  

## **Results & Applications**  
The trained model is capable of segmenting various objects with high precision. Real-world applications include:  
- **Medical Imaging**: Identifying tumors in CT/MRI scans.  
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Detecting road objects, pedestrians, and lane markings.  
- **Satellite Imaging**: Recognizing geographical and environmental changes.  

## **How to Run the Code**  
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas opencv-python matplotlib seaborn
   ```  
2. Load the dataset and preprocess images.  
3. Train the model using the provided **Jupyter Notebook (DSC-680-image-segmentation-final.ipynb)**.  
4. Evaluate performance and visualize segmentation results.  

## **Future Improvements**  
- Enhance segmentation accuracy using **transformer-based models** (e.g., **Segment Anything Model (SAM)**).  
- Implement **real-time segmentation** for video applications.  
- Fine-tune model hyperparameters to improve performance on diverse datasets.
